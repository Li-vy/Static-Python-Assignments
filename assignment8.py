# 1) Create 2 classes for single inheritance named respectively A(base class) and B(derived class)

# 2) Create 3 data members in class A: a(private), b(protected) and c(public) initialise their values in 
# a parameterized constructor

# 3) Create a method known as display in both the classes, to display the values of a,b and c

# 4) While accessing the private member an exception should be raised and a personalized message should 
# be displayed and the exception should be handled properly so that the rest of the code can get executed

class A:
    print('class A')
    
class B (A):
    print()
